Patch created from SourceTree (Actions/Create Patch) is in wrong order,SRCTREEWIN-14208,1945080,Bug,Gathering Impact,rgomis,https://www.sourcetreeapp.com,Medium,Not a bug,30-05-2023 12:58,General,"I selected my range of commits with shift + click, then the patch is created successfully, but i have a surprise when applying it. When i open the patch in editor, i can see that the first commit appears second, and also other commits are in wrong order. In my case, the first commit created a file and second commit edited the file created, so applying it in wrong order lead to a conflict (modification vs ""deletion"", since the file does not exist).Since i dont want to solve those conflicts manually, and i don't want to edit manually the wrong ordered commits, i had to find a workaround to sourcetree ""Create patch"". Here is my workaround, using git bash :  {code:java}git format-patch 86d1e2a32f2d284c9f232082948452ed61b41351^..HEAD --output myPatch.patch(and then to apply : git am myPatch.patch){code}  "

Wrong installation size reported in Control Panel?,SRCTREEWIN-14201,1943796,Bug,Gathering Impact,rgomis,https://www.sourcetreeapp.com,Low,Not a bug,12-05-2023 05:16,General,"The installation size reported in the Control Panel Programs & Features item for user (not Enterprise) Sourcetree seems to be wrong; too low.I installed Sourcetree 3.4.12 just now from SourceTreeSetup-3.4.12.exe. In the Control Panel, it's reported as having an installation size of 24.2 MB. But my `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SourceTree` directory is bigger. * AppData\Local\SourceTree - 78.7 MB / 79.3 MB on disk * AppData\Local\SourceTree\packages - 24.2 MB * AppData\Local\SourceTree\app-3.4.12 - 52.4 MBLooks like it's only reporting the size of the ""packages"" directory? That doesn't seem right. Maybe it should report the app directory or their combined size instead?FWIW, Sourcetree Enterprise reports an installation size of 51 MB, which matches its size in %programfiles(x86)% and is about the size of that ""app"" directory in the user installation above. (I don't see any ""packages"" directory for Sourcetree Enterprise. Maybe that's a nupkg thing, and the MSI works differently?) !image-2023-05-12-10-01-12-427.png|width=594,height=394! !image-2023-05-12-10-01-12-474.png|width=1459,height=61!!image-2023-05-12-10-01-12-508.png|width=1100,height=55!BTW, the user installer is named ""SourceTreeSetup"" and creates an AppData subdirectories named ""SourceTree"" and ""SourceTree*"".

No Start Menu shortcut created by Sourcetree Enterprise installation,SRCTREEWIN-14200,1943795,Bug,Short Term Backlog,rgomis,https://www.sourcetreeapp.com,Low,Not a bug,12-05-2023 05:44,General,"While installing the regular user Sourcetree using the .exe installer creates a ""Sourcetree"" Start Menu item/shortcut for me, the Sourcetree Enterprise MSI installer does not appear to do so. It would be nice if it did so, in the All Users Start Menu, like most Windows applications do.Happened just now with Sourcetree Enterprise 3.4.11 and 3.4.12 on Windows 10 Enterprise Multi-Session for me, but I've been noticing this for a couple years with older Sourcetree versions and various Windows versions (10 Pro, Server 2019, Server 2022 I think); we've been using Sourcetree Enterprise at work since Jan 2020, and I recall it happening the whole time. I've dealt with it by manually creating All Users Start Menu shortcuts for it on all the machines I install it on, but that's a hassle.I'm creating this as a separate ticket from https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8376 and https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-13057, because this seems to be specifically about the Enterprise version, and I'd like it to be able to handle All Users Start Menu shortcuts in a regular installation workflow."
Desktop shortcut and installer names are weird,SRCTREEWIN-14199,1943793,Bug,Short Term Backlog,rgomis,https://www.sourcetreeapp.com,Low,Duplicate,12-05-2023 04:28,General,"Hi, Atlassian folks,A couple minor naming and identification issues with the Sourcetree installation stuff.Some of the names used by items in the Sourcetree installer and the things it creates have weird names. This includes the identification of the installer program itself, and the desktop shortcut.This is for Sourcetree Enterprise 3.4.12, but I've noticed this going on for a while with other versions and non-Enterprise, too. I'm running on Windows 11 Enterprise Multi-Session, but have noticed these things on regular Windows 10 Pro, Windows Server 2019, and I think Windows Server 2022 as well.For the Enterprise MSI installer version, file SourcetreeEnterpriseSetup_3.4.12.msi: * With 3.4.12, When requesting elevation during the install process (when you click the ""Install"" button with the shield icon and a Windows ""do you want to allow this program to make changes to your computer?"" screen pops up to ask for Administrator rights), the program is identified by name as ""13ce64.msi"" or ""13cf77.msi"" or some other weird random-looking name, that seems to vary between runs. Same with 3.4.11. * 3.4.10 and the few versions before that I tried don't have the weird file names, and identify the file by its regular actual path as stored on the machine. But they say it's from ""an unknown publisher"" and there's no certificate or signing details. That file name is more understandable in that it's easier to tell which program on my computer is requesting elevation, but it seems less trustworthy.Did you just start signing the Enterprise MSI installers in version 3.4.11? Maybe you need to use the `/d` option to `signtool` as discussed in this Stack Overflow answer? [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4315840/the-uac-prompt-shows-a-temporary-random-program-name-for-msi-can-the-correct-na]?] * Similar issue with uninstallation. When doing an uninstall from the Windows Control Panel and it prompts for elevation, it identifies the program as like ""C:\Windows\Installer\334948.msi"" (for Sourcetree 3.4.9 I tested just now) or ""...\334a5a.msi"" for Sourcetree 3.4.10, or ""334b69.msi"" (with now path, just the base file name). * Sourcetree Enterprise 3.4.12 (and some previous versions) create a desktop shortcut whose comment is ""Description of Test Setup"". * Regular (non-Enterprise) user Sourcetree 3.4.10 and 3.4.12 create a desktop shortcut whose comment is ""SourceTree"" with a capital ""T""; I think you usually style it ""Sourcetree"". * If you have both regular Sourcetree and Sourcetree Enterprise installed, they look about the same in the ""Programs and Features"" Control Panel's default view, so it's hard to tell which to select if you want to uninstall or otherwise act on one of them. One is ""SourceTree"" version ""3.4.12"", and the other is ""Sourcetree"" version ""3.4.12.0"" (with the zero), but I don't know which of those indicates Enterprise. (You need to go in to the column selector, choose More, and add Location, and then know that the Enterprise version is installed under the main %PROGRAMFILES% (and may show with a blank Location instead here) and user is under the user's %APPDATA%. Kind of an advanced move. But I guess if you're using Enterprise you're maybe advanced already?) Maybe the Name of one of them should be ""Sourcetree Enterprise""?  ** The ""SourceTree"" one is non-Enterprise user Sourcetree, I think. ** The installation Location being blank is a minor bummer too. I'm attaching some various screenshots.Thanks for considering this! (And sorry for my bad Jira formatting here.)Cheers,Andrew!image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-164.png|width=578,height=361!!image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-212.png|width=873,height=66! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-271.png|width=1603,height=52! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-326.png|width=580,height=252! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-399.png|width=575,height=850!!image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-467.png|width=570,height=524! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-537.png|width=573,height=533! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-604.png|width=572,height=520!  !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-772.png|width=574,height=508! !image-2023-05-12-09-43-21-852.png|width=573,height=651! "
Make the list of tags more usable (e.g. descending sort),SRCTREEWIN-14198,1943646,Suggestion,Under Consideration,sahil,https://www.sourcetreeapp.com,,Duplicate,30-05-2023 12:26,UX,"h2. BackgroundThe sort order of tags in the repo sidebar has the most recently added (highest) tags at the bottom of the list. IMHO the most recent tags are the most likely to be used to refer to specific changesets.For active repos that use tags, the list of tags quickly grows very long, and forces users to scroll to click these 'most recent' tags.h2. SuggestionWould you please either:A) Change the default sort order for tags to descending - probably more useful for most people.ORB) Add an option that allows users to choose the sort order of tags (ascending or descending).ORC) Collapse the list and show only the most recent X tags (say the last 10) with a show more option."

Since this is for a company permissions are set via that method.

Scientists are constantly looking for ways to cure diabetes, instead, they have only been able to come up with ingredients and ways to control and manage blood sugar levels. There are many supplements available in the market that claim to support blood sugar levels so it is difficult to figure out which one is better in the lot. GlucoTru is unique in the sense that it targets blood sugar and sleep by interacting with your body in ways to promote a healthy blood sugar level. GlucoTru supplement is a combination of both sleep-enhancing and blood sugar-maintaining qualities so that you can enjoy the benefits of both while only using one supplement and not having a pile of pills to eat every day.The key mechanisms of action that happen when you take one capsule of GlucoTru are described below:[!https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKknFEZ-1tdH_KZTWbVWxyPNOaLr0n-lNDDPucieUH8f0f-G8egZAs5R18UBcFyb2rgq1OqxSZU2Cmu8UfC8qq2gE-LqpYgSeZ3au0fROc8FZiU9xFaar_QtWvDEHi33CdVpvyruuucZ1ekPok-fOTyorDYbAyuNSsTaudig4NW630dT1wYtDuIfXf/w640-h204/Glucotru%20Free%20Shiping.JPG|width=640,height=204!|https://mydealjunction.link/recommend/glucotru]h3. *Supports blood sugar*  ** The primary purpose of GlucoTru is to support blood sugar levels for diabetic and pre-diabetic persons. When people affected with diabetes eat foods particularly rich in sugar or carbs, there is an excessive amount of sugar released into the blood which makes it difficult for the body to produce enough insulin to control this massive amount of sugar, this is called a blood sugar hike which commonly happens after eating. This is known as hyperglycemia and it can have many symptoms such as vomiting, rapid heartbeat, excessive hunger and thirst along with other issues. GlucoTru claims to support and manage blood sugar hikes with the help of natural ingredients such as chromium, cinnamon, biotin, and licorice.  h3. *Promotes deep and peaceful sleep* Lack of sleep can make you more prone to developing diabetes. Your body synthesises essential hormones when you are asleep in order to repair, cleanse, and detox itself. GlucoTru promotes deep and rejuvenating sleep to help your body repair overnight as you sleep. Moreover, your body produces an increased level of cortisol which is a ""belly fat-storing"" hormone. Cortisol transforms the food you eat into a dangerous form of fat known as visceral fat. This type of fat wraps around the abdominal organs. GlucoTru helps to keep the cortisol levels balanced while also boosting the production of leptin which is a hunger-suppressing hormone.  h3. *Has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects* The ingredients in GlucoTru pills are enriched with natural antioxidants. Juniper Berry has a high content of vitamin C which is widely known for its antioxidant properties. These ingredients help your body to reduce the effects of oxidation and oxidative stress in the body which is said to have a possible role in the production of tissue damage in diabetes. GlucoTru can help your body defend itself against oxidation and inflammation which means you have a lower risk of catching any diseases.  All these added benefits of GlucoTru make it stand out in the highly saturated market of blood sugar-regulating supplements. GlucoTru also helps to enhance the overall functioning and health of the body while keeping blood sugar levels within the normal range.    [!https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCYVlHxys9H7b0BNISZTbXfAj1nMs8MxA_k7FOEK1_QvysrN5fxz7AwlV2tPgad_OjNlArZ-zSEh-86F0ZvHGGjxG04wVXRh5lvw9wFJexDq8qegHDq0dvf7S8GcZwG6ebHAzfXmjwNLCWOXi4ytcZo5Fjk5qTeQV6-xtFcBeLXZ8NFpUqkDVj_7n_/w640-h334/Glucotru%20Blood%20Sugar.JPG|width=640,height=334!|https://mydealjunction.link/recommend/glucotru] [*(Get Up to 75% Off on GlucoTru) Click Here to Buy While Discount Promo Lasts*|https://mydealjunction.link/recommend/glucotru]h2. *GlucoTru Ingredients*GlucoTru comprises all-natural ingredients which are scientifically proven to be beneficial for the body. Ingredients used in GlucoTru pills are of high quality and the final product is tested through several trials to ensure its safety. The ingredients used in GlucoTru are mentioned below: *Gymnema Sylvestre* Gymnema has long been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicines. It is commonly found in many blood sugar-maintaining supplements nowadays. This ingredient helps to suppress appetite and assists with weight loss, while also keeping blood sugar levels within the normal range.  *Biotin* Biotin is a vitamin B that is also very commonly used in supplements to help diabetic people. According to studies, biotin helps to convert the food you eat into energy and efficiently metabolises fats, carbs, and proteins to support healthy sugar levels in the blood. Biotin is also known to be beneficial for the skin, hair, nails, nerves, and more.  ** *Chromium* It has been studied that diabetic people have low chromium levels in their blood, which is a type of mineral that helps to keep blood sugar levels at bay. Chromium in GlucoTru pills can help in supporting the metabolism and boosts fat burn.   *Manganese*Manganese is another mineral that helps to stimulate the production of insulin. Moreover, manganese also helps to promote the function of the nervous system and brain. GlucoTru contains manganese so you can reap the amazing benefits of this ingredient with every capsule.  *Licorice* Licorice root has traditionally been used in medicines for ages. It is widely known for its ability to suppress appetite and is rich in flavonoids that can help to burn fat rapidly. It also has effects on the sugar in the blood and so is used in many blood sugar-regulating supplements. *Cinnamon*Cinnamon is a famous spice that is linked to many therapeutic effects. According to studies, cinnamon can help to support blood sugar and heart health. Cinnamon also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help to support healthy inflammation throughout the body.  *Zinc*There is a considerable amount of zinc in GlucoTru. This mineral is important for diabetics as it can help to stimulate the production of insulin in the pancreas so that the sugar can be broken down and utilised effectively. *Juniper Berries* Juniper berries are enriched with vitamin C, one of the best natural antioxidants. Though it has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, modern studies are also backing the efficacy of juniper berries. They are used in GlucoTru as they are beneficial for the immune system too. The ingredients are what make the GlucoTru dietary supplement so effective in maintaining the glucose levels in the blood.

The fast-paced world of today’s age has resulted in many dangerous diseases and disorders, one of which is diabetes. While type 1 diabetes is mostly because of genetic disturbances, type 2 diabetes is acquired in which a lot of factors play a part. About 10.5% of the US population or an estimated 34.2 million people are suffering from diabetes, which is a lifelong condition that requires a lot of patience and care. Diabetes is a disease that cannot be cured and there are only ways to maintain blood sugar levels once someone has been diagnosed with diabetes. Scientists are constantly trying to come up with a solution to help people with type 2 diabetes into remission. Remission is when the blood glucose levels are in a normal range but this does not mean that it is a way to cure diabetes, instead, it only helps to keep the glucose levels within the normal range. Although the exact cause of diabetes is unknown, there are many factors that can contribute to diabetes. Type one diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction in which the body reacts with and destroys the cells in the pancreas that makes insulin known as the beta cells, type 2 diabetes is caused by a number of genetic or environmental factors. A few of these factors include obesity, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, family history, genetic disturbances and mutations, and hormonal diseases.   People nowadays live a very sedentary and inactive life, which is a huge contributing factor to diabetes. The use of heavily processed foods, carbonated drinks, red meat, and processed meats has increased colossally which is causing many issues for people. Physical inactivity also contributes to diabetes and the digitalization of the world is one of the main culprits of many diseases. Life with diabetes is very difficult, and it is very important to control blood sugar in order to prevent any hikes that can be extremely detrimental. Therefore, it is very important to manage and keep blood sugar levels within the normal range. There are many supplements and medications available on the market that claim to maintain the blood sugar levels for people who have diabetes but very few of them are effective, and some of them also come with a lot of side effects. GlucoTru is a formula that was created by a man named James Walker who partnered up with a nutritional support company named Maximum Edge Nutrition to develop a blood sugar support supplement that has little to no side effects and is affordable for everyone. [https://www.mastersindia.co/q/question/glucotru-reviews-all-you-need-to-know-about-glucotru-blood-sugar-support-formula-offer/][https://infogram.com/glucotru-reviews-all-you-need-to-know-about-glucotru-blood-sugar-support-formula-offer-1ho16vor05xnx4n][https://www.sympla.com.br/produtor/glucotrureviews][https://www.scoop.it/topic/glucotru-reviews][https://soundcloud.com/glucotru-reviews/glucotru-reviews-blood-sugar-support-formula][https://www.crunchbase.com/event/glucotru][https://www.sympla.com.br/produtor/glucotrureviewscostsideeffects][https://getglucotru.clubeo.com/calendar/2023/04/14/glucotru-reviews-scam-exposed-2023-does-glucotru-blood-sugar-support-formula-available-on-amazon-offer][https://getglucotru.clubeo.com/page/glucotru-reviews-scam-exposed-2023-does-glucotru-blood-sugar-support-formula-available-on-amazon-offer.html][https://www.mastersindia.co/q/question/glucotru-reviews-scam-exposed-2023does-glucotru-blood-sugar-support-formula-available-on-amazon-offer/][https://www.sympla.com.br/produtor/glucotrubloodsugarsupportformula][https://glucotru-reviews.company.site/][https://www.fuzia.com/fz/zafar-glucotru-reviews][https://www.fuzia.com/article_detail/780703/glucotru-reviews-scam-exposed-2023does-glucotru-blood-s][https://glucotru-reviews.jimdosite.com/][https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/411946c2-6557-422a-9238-bcc3fcc4e73c][https://feedingtrends.com/glucotru-reviews-scam-exposed-2023]"

This is a feature I often use for new files, however, it's currently only possible to stage lines and hunks in new files, it's not possible to unstage lines and hunks.Use cases for new files include: * Splitting a new file into multiple themed commits for ease of review * Running new database migrations multiple times and resetting the AUTO_INCREMENT counter during development but not wanting to check the reset part of the query into the repositoryUsually I'd like to stage the whole file, then remove certain lines. However, currently I have to either stage an empty file, then selectively stage just the lines I want, or temporarily delete the lines I don't want to commit, then stage the whole file.Please allow new files to have their lines and hunks unstaged the same way it's already possible to do with existing files."
